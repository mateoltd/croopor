# Version Metadata Architecture
This is the current Minecraft-version interpretation model. Keep it accurate. If version naming, lifecycle classification, or ordering changes, update this file in the same change.

## Purpose
The backend owns two separate concerns:

- `minecraft_meta`: what kind of Minecraft version this is structurally
- `lifecycle`: how mature that version is in launcher terms

That split is deliberate. Loader builds use a different metadata contract and are documented separately in `docs/LOADER-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Source of truth
The authority lives in:

- `core/minecraft/src/version_meta/mod.rs`
- `core/minecraft/src/version_meta/parse.rs`
- `core/minecraft/src/version_meta/tokenize.rs`

It produces:

- `MinecraftVersionMeta`
- `LifecycleMeta`

Those fields are attached to:

- vanilla catalog entries from `/api/v1/catalog`
- installed/local versions from `/api/v1/versions`
- loader-supported Minecraft versions from `/api/v1/loaders/components/{id}/game-versions`

## Record model
Minecraft-version records expose:

- `subject_kind = minecraft_version` for catalog and loader-supported records
- `subject_kind = installed_version` for installed/local version records
- `raw_kind`: upstream kind string when available
- `minecraft_meta`
- `lifecycle`

`MinecraftVersionMeta` carries:

- `family`
- `base_id`
- `effective_version`
- `variant_of`
- `variant_kind`
- `display_name`
- `display_hint`

`LifecycleMeta` carries:

- `channel`: `stable | preview | experimental | legacy | unknown`
- `labels`
- `default_rank`
- `badge_text`
- `provider_terms`

`minecraft_meta` does not own maturity anymore. `lifecycle` does.

Installed-version scans also carry a backend-authored scan state alongside the version rows. The state distinguishes `ready`, `empty`, and `degraded`: a missing `versions/` directory is a fresh empty library, while unreadable directories, missing/malformed version JSON outside an `.incomplete` install marker, or malformed materialized loader identity degrade the scan. AppState owns the immutable current-library snapshot used by version routes and watches, instance and create views, POST create selection/readiness/enrichment, presence, launch preflight, and Performance health and target staging. The canonical core scan records an opaque dependency stamp for every root, entry, version JSON, incomplete marker, jar, and inherited-parent probe it actually observes; State revalidates that stamp with blocking metadata work under the caller's accepted lifecycle producer and coalesces stale refreshes. Stable ready, empty, and degraded snapshots have no TTL, while an unavailable or changing dependency set remains non-cacheable and fail-closed. Launcher-owned install, delete, and library setup transitions explicitly invalidate the snapshot. Public timing exposes only the closed lookup source and refresh count, never library paths, dependency metadata, scan issues, or custom version names. There is no Application-owned scanner or request-local compatibility cache.

Installed loader versions are classified from a strictly decoded and canonically re-encoded `loader-v2` identity. Current launcher-authored profiles carry an exact `inheritsFrom` even though their launch model is already materialized. `axialMaterialized = true` prevents a second inheritance merge only after the folder id, profile id, decoded component/Minecraft/loader coordinates, and declared parent agree. Malformed, noncanonical, or mismatched identity fails closed. The validated Minecraft target then drives display, lifecycle, Java inheritance, readiness, and ordering; no separate metadata file can supply a missing parent or compatibility fallback.

Loader-supported Minecraft-version rows can also carry provider stability hints. Some providers use this as Minecraft-version stability, such as Fabric and Quilt marking snapshot/prerelease game rows; those hints affect lifecycle display but do not by themselves mean loader builds are beta-only. Providers that derive the hint from build availability, currently Forge and NeoForge, may use a negative hint to indicate only unstable loader builds exist for that Minecraft target. Create-view renders that as a backend-authored beta tag, but the row remains selectable; version-level loader creation resolves the best stable build first and falls back to the best provider-ranked unstable build when no stable build exists. Build-level create-view exceptions, such as Quilt Java compatibility guards, use fresh cached build metadata when available and may render conservative non-blocking tags when live build metadata is intentionally deferred; submit/install paths re-resolve builds through the full loader catalog authority. The hint is serialized as part of normalized loader catalog cache data so cached supported-version rows re-enrich to the same lifecycle as fresh provider rows.

```

## Layer responsibilities
### 1. Tokenizer
`tokenize.rs` converts a raw id into tolerant typed tokens:

- `number`
- `word`
- `separator`

It stays generic and should not own family policy.

### 2. Structural parser
`parse.rs` detects Minecraft version shapes and strips variant suffixes.

Current shapes include:

- release
- pre-release
- release candidate
- release snapshot
- weekly snapshot
- combat test
- experimental snapshot
- deep dark experimental snapshot
- old beta
- old alpha
- unknown

### 3. Semantic interpreter
`mod.rs` is the policy layer.

It decides:

- `minecraft_meta.family`
- `minecraft_meta.effective_version`
- `minecraft_meta.display_name`
- `minecraft_meta.display_hint`
- `lifecycle.channel`
- `lifecycle.labels`
- sort precedence

## Classification rules
Examples:

- `25w46a`
  - `family = weekly_snapshot`
  - `lifecycle.channel = preview`
  - `lifecycle.labels = [snapshot]`
- `1.21.11-pre5`
  - `family = pre_release`
  - `lifecycle.channel = preview`
  - `lifecycle.labels = [pre_release]`
- `1.7.10_pre4`
  - `family = pre_release`
  - `lifecycle.channel = preview`
  - `lifecycle.labels = [pre_release]`
- `1.21.11-rc3`
  - `family = release_candidate`
  - `lifecycle.channel = preview`
  - `lifecycle.labels = [release_candidate]`
- `26.1-snapshot-9`
  - `family = release_snapshot`
  - `lifecycle.channel = preview`
  - `lifecycle.labels = [snapshot]`
- loader-supported `26.2` from a provider that reports only beta loader builds
  - `family = release`
  - `lifecycle.channel = preview`
  - `lifecycle.labels = [beta]`
  - create-view row includes a backend-authored `Beta` tag and remains selectable
- `b1.7.3`
  - `family = old_beta`
  - `lifecycle.channel = legacy`
  - `lifecycle.labels = [old_beta]`
- `a1.2.6`
  - `family = old_alpha`
  - `lifecycle.channel = legacy`
  - `lifecycle.labels = [old_alpha]`
- an unknown id with upstream `raw_kind = old_beta` or `old_alpha`
  - `family` follows that raw kind
  - `lifecycle.channel = legacy`
  - the raw kind is not treated as a release fallback

## Effective version
`effective_version` is the practical release target or grouping anchor.

Examples:

- `1.21.11-pre5` -> `1.21.11`
- `1.21.11-rc3` -> `1.21.11`
- snapshot estimates represent the incoming edition: when a snapshot technically anchors to or timeline-matches an existing release, `effective_version` advances to the immediate next known release
- `26.1-snapshot-9` -> immediate next known release after `26.1`; falls back to `26.1` when no later release is known
- `1.16_combat-3` -> `1.16`
- `25w46a` -> nearest release by manifest timestamp

## Ordering rules
Installed version ordering is backend-owned and currently follows:

1. lifecycle priority
2. release time descending when available
3. effective version descending
4. family priority
5. base id descending
6. variant priority
7. raw id descending

Loader-supported Minecraft versions use:

1. Mojang manifest order when known
2. backend fallback version comparison otherwise

The fallback comparator stays deterministic even for unknown shapes.

## Frontend contract
Frontend code should:

- render version labels through `frontend/src/version-display.ts`
- use `minecraftVersionLabel()` for Minecraft-only UI labels
- never render or parse opaque `loader-v2-*` ids as Minecraft versions; backend metadata must provide `inherits_from` and normalized Minecraft metadata
- installed loader attachments must come from the backend's strict canonical-id and materialized-profile validator; frontend code must not parse raw version ids
- loader create rows must use backend-authored exact build identity (`component_id`, `build_id`, target version id, Minecraft version, loader version, installability, and catalog availability); frontend code must not infer preferred builds or installed/full state from component id + Minecraft version groupings
- loader create row tags are backend-authored; frontend code renders tags such as `Beta` but does not decide loader stability or compatibility
- use `normalizeVersionDisplay()` / `versionSearchText()` for version picker rows and filtering
- use `lifecycle` for filtering and badges
- avoid re-parsing vanilla-like version ids locally

## Maintenance rules
- add new Mojang naming families in `version_meta/mod.rs`, not in the frontend
- do not overload `family` as a maturity field
- do not reintroduce top-level `type` or `canonical_kind`
- if lifecycle policy changes, update both this doc and `docs/LOADER-ARCHITECTURE.md`
