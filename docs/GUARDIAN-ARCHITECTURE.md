# Guardian Architecture
Guardian is Croopor's horizontal safety intelligence layer. It exists so the launcher can keep working when runtime configuration, downloads, local state, performance state, connectivity, or user overrides are messy, without scattering safety policy across route handlers, Execution primitives, Performance helpers, Healing copy, session heuristics, and frontend code.

Guardian is not only a launch-time checker. It is the safety authority that receives facts from the rest of the backend, diagnoses risk, chooses the allowed safety action, orchestrates lower-level repair systems, records evidence, and emits bounded user-facing outcomes. Self-healing is a Guardian subsystem, not a separate top-level policy authority.

## Goal
For every safety-relevant operation phase, Guardian answers:

`given the request, observed facts, ownership, failure memory, current operation context, and configured safety mode, what safety decision protects the user and keeps the app functional?`

That decision covers:
- whether the operation is allowed
- whether Guardian may warn, intervene, repair, retry, degrade, roll back, suppress, or block
- which lower-level subsystem is allowed to execute the action
- what evidence must be recorded
- what public summary or notice the user should see
- why Guardian did not act when a safety-relevant failure occurred

## Layer Model
Guardian has a foot in every backend system, but it should not absorb every implementation detail.

- Application owns command staging, operation identity, route orchestration, and command result shape.
- Execution owns primitive facts and concrete effects: file, download, JVM, runtime, process, and launch effects.
- Performance owns performance plan resolution, health, composition state, rollback snapshots, benchmark/qualification semantics, and performance operation execution.
- State owns live/durable sessions, operation journals, failure memory, and proof state.
- Observability owns evidence tiers, redaction, local proof records, and any future telemetry-safe export boundary.
- Interface/API owns DTO and view-model boundaries that let the frontend render without reconstructing policy.
- Frontend owns draft UI state, event wiring, and rendering backend-authored states, actions, notices, and progress.
- Guardian owns safety diagnosis, action selection, self-healing orchestration, public safety outcomes, and safety non-intervention reasons.

Guardian coordinates those systems through structured facts and bounded actions. It should not become a giant list of route-local conditionals, and lower layers should not smuggle product safety decisions back into helpers.

## Current Implemented Surface
Guardian currently has working proof across these areas:

- launch/runtime/JVM preflight facts for undefined, null, empty, missing, probe-failing, probe-timeout, wrong-major, outdated, incompatible, and bad custom Java overrides
- malformed or unsupported JVM argument and preset facts
- create/update JVM preset catalog and normalization for undefined, blank, automatic, supported, unknown, and tampered preset values, with bounded create notices and no raw preset echo
- launch readiness facts for missing metadata, incomplete install markers, missing jars/libraries/assets, and managed-runtime readiness
- managed-runtime ready-marker repair before session creation when ownership, journal, persisted runtime proof/checksum postcondition, and failure-memory gates allow it
- memory, CPU, concurrent launch, active install/download, low disk, and Custom override warnings
- startup stall, pre-boot exit, crash-after-boot, clean external close, and launcher-stop session outcome separation
- one startup recovery attempt when the target and failure memory allow it
- State-backed failure-memory persistence for Guardian suppression windows and occurrence counts across API/desktop restarts
- install/download artifact evidence for checksum, size, missing-artifact, metadata, provider, network, permission, ownership, temp-write, promote, and success facts
- Guardian-authored install safety outcomes for provider, network, interrupted, invalid-metadata, permission-denied, temp-write, promotion-failed, and ownership-refused failures that are not artifact-repair candidates
- one-shot launcher-managed artifact repair when checksum, size, or missing selected-artifact facts exactly match a private selected descriptor
- install repair outcome journaling and failure-memory suppression
- State-backed operation-journal persistence for bounded current operation records, including install status/event restart replay of terminal progress and Guardian repair summaries when the transient install session snapshot is gone
- Observability-bounded operation proofs derived from terminal journals, so failed install status and terminal queued Performance operation status can connect operation facts, Guardian diagnosis/action/outcome evidence, and latest verification facts without leaking raw provider, filesystem, or JVM material
- a bounded direct Performance mutation path for synchronous API/test callers: it journals internally with generated ids and returns sanitized JSON errors, while queued Performance operation status remains the user-facing proof surface
- performance facts for invalid rules, degraded/fallback/invalid health, user-owned conflicts, repeated failures, and rollback availability
- persisted operation-state load diagnostics for strict-schema performance operation and benchmark suite driver records; Guardian maps aggregate load issues to a bounded startup warning instead of letting restart-resume corruption disappear silently
- public/exportable redaction for Guardian outcomes, launch notices, session status/events, install status/events, operation status, performance health/status, operation journals, and local proof exports

`apps/api/src/application/authority.rs` is the local proof gate for this model. Its tests enforce route adapter boundaries, frontend non-policy rendering, Execution non-policy, required source/control-plane reproducibility, and a quality-gate failure-scenario matrix that points every required Guardian failure scenario at local behavior tests.

Not every domain has a specialized automatic repair workflow yet. When Guardian does not have a specific workflow, it still owns the safety interpretation if the issue crosses a safety boundary: it should cushion damage by producing a bounded block, warning, degraded state, retry suppression, or user-facing notice rather than letting raw errors or frontend guesses escape.

## Modes
### Managed
Intent:
- the launcher actively protects the user from technical mistakes and damaged launcher-managed state

Policy:
- Guardian may replace incompatible Java overrides with managed Java
- Guardian may strip fatal raw JVM args
- Guardian may downgrade or disable unsafe GC/preset choices
- Guardian may repair launcher-managed runtime and artifact state when ownership and postcondition gates pass
- Guardian may allow one bounded startup recovery when the startup window fails
- Guardian may degrade or fall back when Performance marks that path safe
- Guardian must journal what it changed and emit bounded public copy

### Custom
Intent:
- the launcher respects explicit technical choices while still enforcing hard safety invariants

Policy:
- Guardian does not silently mutate explicit user intent
- Guardian warns when explicit Java, JVM preset, or raw JVM argument overrides are preserved
- Guardian blocks guaranteed-fatal override combinations before spawn
- Guardian blocks explicit named JVM presets before spawn when the selected runtime is known not to support the emitted flags
- Guardian can cushion unsafe Custom state with guidance, bounded errors, or non-destructive checks
- automatic mutation of user-owned or unknown-owned state is not allowed

### Disabled
Intent:
- the user has explicitly opted out of normal Guardian intervention

Policy:
- Guardian does not perform normal repair or warning interventions
- hard invariants still block unsafe unjournaled mutation, user-owned destructive repair, or unredacted public output
- safety-relevant non-intervention should still be explainable in local evidence when possible

## Decision Loop
Guardian decisions follow the same shape even when a domain has only partial workflow coverage:

1. Fact intake
   Lower systems emit structured facts with source, phase, ownership, target, evidence fields, and sensitivity.

2. Diagnosis
   Guardian maps facts into diagnoses with domain, diagnosis id, confidence, severity, ownership, and public reason templates.

3. Risk and action pressure
   Guardian combines severity, confidence, blast radius, reversibility, ownership, user intent, operation phase, mode, and failure memory into an action decision.

4. Action selection
   Guardian chooses allow, warn, intervene, repair, retry, degrade, rollback, suppress, ask, or block. Unsupported or unsafe actions become bounded warnings/blocks instead of improvised mutation.

5. Plan and ownership gates
   Any mutating plan must have launcher-managed or composition-managed ownership, an operation journal, a rollback/quarantine/postcondition story where applicable, redaction-ready public output, and loop-control checks.

6. Execution by lower layer
   Execution, Performance, runtime, install, or process helpers perform the concrete effect. Guardian authorizes; lower layers execute.

7. Verification and memory
   The postcondition is checked, the operation journal records success/failure/block/suppression, and failure memory prevents repeated destructive or useless loops.

8. Public outcome
   Guardian emits bounded message/details, intervention summaries, or non-intervention reasons. Raw paths, Java paths, JVM args, command lines, provider payloads, account ids, usernames, tokens, server addresses, and token-like strings do not cross public or exportable boundaries.

## Core Data Model
### Inputs
Guardian reasons from explicit facts:
- Guardian mode and operation phase
- command kind and operation id
- ownership class for every target
- explicit Java override presence and origin
- explicit JVM preset and raw JVM args presence and origin
- required Java major/update facts
- effective runtime facts and managed-runtime readiness
- target Minecraft version, loader component, and modded state from installed metadata
- selected memory bounds and host resource observations
- active launch, install/download, and performance operation pressure
- launch readiness diagnostics
- startup observations: boot marker, log evidence, exit code, stall, clean stop, launcher stop
- download/install facts and private selected launcher-managed descriptors
- performance rules, composition, health, rollback, and failure-memory facts
- prior attempts and suppression windows
- redaction readiness for any public/exportable output

### Outputs
Guardian outputs normalized safety results:
- decision: `allowed | warned | intervened | blocked | suppressed | repaired | degraded | rollback`
- diagnosis ids and confidence/severity
- action plan and prerequisite metadata
- ownership and target descriptors
- operation/journal ids when a mutation or repair is involved
- user-facing `message`, ordered `details`, optional guidance, and intervention summary
- evidence for why Guardian acted or did not act

## Self-Healing
Self-healing is the Guardian subsystem that turns an approved action plan into a bounded repair attempt.

It owns:
- repair plan validation
- ownership gates
- journal requirements
- rollback/quarantine/postcondition requirements
- failure-memory loop control
- public repair outcome shape

It orchestrates:
- managed-runtime ready-marker repair after persisted manifest/checksum proof verification
- selected launcher-managed artifact quarantine/redownload/promote
- selected missing launcher-managed artifact download/promote
- performance fallback/degraded decisions and rollback eligibility through the Performance system

It does not own raw provider selection, arbitrary file deletion, user-owned file mutation, or unbounded retry loops.

## Launch Runtime And JVM
Runtime, JVM, and launch preparation code emit facts and provide execution hooks. Guardian decides whether to keep a requested runtime, switch to managed runtime, strip or preserve raw JVM args, disable custom GC, downgrade a preset, warn, repair, or block.

Explicit Java override probes are bounded. A Java executable that fails, hangs, emits unparseable version output, reports the wrong major version, or reports an unsafe Java 8 update is converted into a redacted runtime fact for Guardian instead of blocking preflight indefinitely or leaking the raw path.

Managed runtime absence and managed runtime corruption are separate safety shapes. Expected absence in Managed mode remains recoverable so Execution can ensure/download the runtime. A present launcher-owned managed runtime with a missing ready marker, corrupt ready marker, missing persisted component-manifest proof, checksum drift, missing Java executable, or non-executable Java executable is treated as corrupt state: Guardian plans the bounded repair, records journal and failure-memory evidence, verifies the full content postcondition, and blocks before session creation when repair cannot make the runtime ready. Execution refuses to recreate a ready marker when the runtime contents cannot be verified from persisted proof.

Guardian preflight outcomes include typed execution directives for the current safe launch-attempt interventions, such as using managed Java for the attempt or stripping explicit JVM args for the attempt. Application launch code may execute those directives, but it must not infer the intervention from diagnosis ids, raw Java paths, raw JVM args, or frontend state.

Instance create/update also uses Guardian-owned JVM preset normalization. The create-view DTO exposes the supported preset catalog. Undefined, blank, or `auto` preset input stores Automatic; supported ids store that explicit preset; unknown or tampered create input resets to Automatic and returns a bounded `guardian_notice`. Instance update applies the same preset normalization before persistence. Raw Java path and raw JVM argument overrides may be stored for backend launch preparation, but update responses redact those strings and launch preflight turns them into Guardian facts before any user-facing outcome.

Launch preparation and launch-session execution are backend-owned under the Application launch modules. API launch routes adapt HTTP/SSE transport and call those Application entrypoints; they do not own Guardian preflight, runtime repair, startup recovery, or session outcome policy. The frontend does not decide readiness, compute effective memory policy, classify Java/JVM failures, choose Guardian/Healing precedence, or synthesize crash warnings.

## Session Outcomes
Session code collects observations and preserves bounded history. It distinguishes:
- clean external close after boot
- launcher stop
- startup crash before boot
- startup stall
- crash after boot
- unknown or failed exits

Guardian owns the safety interpretation when those observations affect user-facing outcomes. Closing Minecraft through the game window after startup is a clean `ExternalUserClosed` outcome and does not produce a crash warning unless the backend explicitly authors a notice. Startup-failure log signals are timestamped session facts; only signals still correlated with the terminal exit window can drive a failure outcome, while stale signals remain historical evidence. Loader bootstrap markers such as ModLauncher/FML output require failure context before they become a loader-bootstrap failure; ordinary loader progress logs remain startup activity only. The process supervisor keeps startup monitoring open until a real boot marker is observed; ordinary stdout/stderr activity is preserved as evidence but does not prove the game opened successfully. If the boot marker never arrives and the watchdog fires, State records a stalled startup outcome with redacted Execution process evidence, and Guardian authors the public recovery or block outcome.

Java signature failures from launcher-managed jars are classified separately from generic startup crashes. Known `SecurityException` signer mismatch and invalid signature digest shapes produce the `launcher_managed_artifact_signature` failure class, a launcher-managed artifact signature corruption fact, bounded repair guidance, and no raw JVM log output.

## Install And Download
Install/download systems emit redacted facts and keep private selected descriptors for repair planning. `apps/api/src/application/install.rs` owns install operation identity, live install queue command/status view models, duplicate suppression, retry queue placement, pending queue removal, worker coordination, journal recording, progress redaction, loader install coordination, Guardian artifact repair invocation, repair outcome shaping, install status responses, and backend-authored failed-install view models for public failure copy, retry availability, and repair action state. `apps/api/src/state/installs.rs` stores live install sessions and the in-memory queue snapshot; the queue is not the durable proof surface. `apps/api/src/application/install/stream.rs` owns install and loader progress stream preparation, history replay, terminal handling, closed-channel cleanup, missing-session copy, and progress event serialization. Install and loader routes parse requests, call Application entrypoints, and serialize backend-authored responses; they do not own repair policy, retry safety, operation journal semantics, queue copy, or stream policy.

Guardian can repair only launcher-managed artifacts when the failed checksum, size, or selected-missing-artifact fact exactly matches a private selected descriptor and ownership/postcondition gates pass. Core Minecraft emits selected facts/descriptors with Guardian-safe semantic target ids and requires valid SHA-1 metadata for selected launcher-managed artifacts; missing or invalid checksum metadata fails closed as metadata evidence instead of being treated as verified. Application adapts those facts to Guardian evidence, and Guardian selects the missing-artifact repair plan that verifies the destination is still absent before downloading/promoting without quarantine. Provider, network, and interrupted failures produce retry-oriented Guardian outcomes. Invalid provider metadata, filesystem permission denial, temp-write failure, atomic promotion failure, and ownership refusal produce blocking Guardian outcomes and never mutate automatically. Temp-discard and success facts do not trigger automatic artifact repair or terminal Guardian outcomes today; they remain bounded evidence/status inputs and must not expose raw provider or filesystem output.

After Guardian repairs a launcher-managed install artifact, Application may resume the same install once. Guardian repair status alone is not install success: the resumed worker must complete the full install before success progress is emitted. If the resumed install fails, the final backend failure remains terminal and journaled. Loader library downloads emit the same selected library evidence as vanilla library downloads, so loader library artifact failures can feed this same repair path.

Loader provider fetches follow the same authority split. Core classifies provider network failures, timeouts, HTTP status families, oversized bodies, schema drift, and missing artifacts as structured loader failure kinds without embedding raw URLs, response bodies, or provider errors in public status. Stale loader cache fallback remains observable through bounded availability fields instead of hiding the provider failure. Application records loader provider failures into the install operation journal, and Guardian authors retry or repeated-failure block outcomes. State failure memory suppresses repeated loader-provider retries within the cooldown so connectivity failures cannot spin indefinitely.

Loader base-version dependencies also use the install integrity model. Loader install only treats a base Minecraft version as already installed when its version metadata, client jar, incomplete marker state, and selected base libraries are ready; otherwise it reruns the vanilla install path so inherited loader libraries cannot stay missing behind an existing base JSON/JAR pair. When a loader install must install or repair a base Minecraft version internally, core returns the same redacted vanilla install facts and selected descriptors to Application through a bounded base-install failure instead of hiding the lower-level install failure. Application records those facts/outcomes and can invoke Guardian artifact repair using the descriptors. If no lower-level safety facts are available, the dependent loader operation records `install_dependency_failed` and blocks with Guardian-authored public copy.

## Performance
Performance owns plan resolution, health, composition locks, managed artifact mutation, rollback snapshots, benchmark/qualification semantics, and queued performance operations.

`apps/api/src/application/performance.rs` and `apps/api/src/application/performance/workflow.rs` own performance route orchestration: status and refresh response shaping, plan and health result carriers, Guardian performance fact adaptation, proof/view-model construction, rollback response semantics, queued operation creation/resume/status, terminal operation-proof composition, and coordination of Performance-owned managed-artifact mutation. `apps/api/src/routes/performance.rs` only parses HTTP requests, calls those Application entrypoints, and serializes backend-authored responses.

Guardian consumes Performance facts for invalid remote rules, degraded or fallback health, invalid ownership, repeated failure, and rollback availability. Guardian can recommend or record degraded/fallback/rollback-safe states, but concrete composition mutation stays in Performance and must respect composition-managed ownership.

Benchmark qualification status labels/tones, target labels, suite/schema labels, missing-evidence summaries, suite/evidence summaries, and per-target required/suite/proof/missing copy are Performance-authored view-model fields. Performance rule-status Settings copy/tone and Performance health summaries are also backend-authored: source/channel labels, validation tone, warning display copy, health copy, bounded composition descriptor, apply/repair action availability, and rollback action availability come from Application/Performance shaping, not frontend token interpretation. Queued Performance operation status responses are also Performance Application-authored view-model boundaries: terminality, completion, progress phase/count, title/detail, and tone come from backend status shaping, not frontend token interpretation. Benchmark suite-driver stop/resume/qualification-check availability is Launch Application workflow state because that boundary owns suite driver lifecycle, active-session checks, and explicit resume/stop behavior. Launch proof outcome, comparison, Guardian/Healing evidence precedence, and resource-budget pressure/details are also Launch Application-authored export view-model fields built from sanitized local proof records. The frontend renders those fields and does not reconstruct Guardian or Performance severity from raw status tokens.

Strict current-schema restart-resume records for performance operations and benchmark suite drivers are State-owned launcher data. When those records cannot be trusted at startup because the directory cannot be read, an entry cannot be read, a status file is invalid, an id is unsafe, or a pending performance status is malformed, State records only a bounded load-issue kind/count. Guardian converts the aggregate into the `persisted_state_schema_invalid` diagnosis and a redacted startup warning on `/api/v1/status`. This warning is non-mutating: Croopor keeps running, ignores untrusted restart-resume records instead of resuming unsafe work, and never rewrites or deletes user-owned or unknown-owned files in this path.

Guardian failure memory itself is State-owned launcher data. State loads and saves the strict snapshot under `<config_dir>/guardian/failure-memory.json`, validates redacted descriptors, bounds retention, and writes through the managed atomic file capability. Guardian remains the policy owner: it records observations, chooses suppression/repair/retry/block/degrade behavior from the loaded entries, and lets expired launch-recovery suppression windows allow a new bounded attempt instead of permanently blocking recovery.

Operation journals are also State-owned launcher data. State loads and saves a bounded strict snapshot under `<config_dir>/state/operation-journals.json`, validates structured ids and redacted public facts, prunes current-state retention, and writes through the managed atomic file capability. Guardian and Application author facts, diagnosis ids, repair outcomes, and workflow progress; State stores them without deciding safety policy, privacy policy, retry eligibility, repair authorization, proof export, or telemetry. Install status and event streams can use a restart-loaded journal to replay bounded terminal progress and Guardian repair summaries when the transient install session snapshot no longer exists. Queued Performance execution uses the durable operation status id as the matching journal id, so terminal Performance operation status can expose the same Observability-compacted proof when the journal is available. Direct non-queued Performance mutation calls are not the canonical user-facing proof path: they keep generated internal journal ids and bounded synchronous JSON errors, while the UI/observable lifecycle path uses queued operation status. Observability can compact a terminal journal into a redacted operation proof for install and Performance status surfaces, preserving Guardian-authored diagnosis/outcome evidence and latest generated facts while dropping or redacting sensitive free text.

## Observability, Redaction, And Telemetry
Observability is the redaction and evidence boundary.

Evidence tiers are:
- internal local
- user visible
- exportable proof
- optional telemetry export

Current code has local evidence and exportable proof records. The config contains `telemetry_enabled` as a disabled-by-default consent flag only; there is no current upload pipeline or remote diagnostics channel. Any future telemetry must export sanitized evidence and cannot be required for local Guardian behavior.

Public and exportable output must not expose raw:
- tokens
- account identifiers
- usernames unless intentionally bounded
- filesystem paths
- Java paths
- JVM args
- command lines
- provider payloads
- server addresses
- token-like strings

## Frontend Contract
The frontend renders backend-authored safety state.

It may:
- keep draft form state
- submit commands
- subscribe to progress/status streams
- render backend actions, view models, notices, and details
- show optimistic presentation only where the backend contract explicitly allows it

It must not:
- decide launch readiness
- classify exits
- parse raw JVM args for policy
- choose whether Guardian or Healing wins
- infer install/download repair status
- decide performance health or rollback policy
- decide auth/account/skin readiness or action availability
- turn raw diagnostics into user-facing copy

## Invariants
- Guardian is the single safety authority.
- Self-healing is a Guardian subsystem.
- Lower systems emit facts and execute approved effects; they do not own product safety decisions.
- Frontend renders backend-authored policy.
- No automatic mutation happens without known owned state, journaling, redaction, and loop control.
- Unknown ownership is treated as user-owned.
- Public/exportable diagnostics are redacted before crossing the boundary.
- Every Guardian intervention records evidence, diagnosis, confidence, severity, ownership, action, outcome, and user-facing summary.
- Every non-intervention in a safety-relevant failure should be explainable by mode, ownership, unsupported action, low confidence, suppression, or missing safe workflow.

## Known Boundaries
- Session startup/failure inference still depends on log and process observations, but those are facts, not policy.
- Automatic install repair is currently specific to selected launcher-managed checksum/size/missing-artifact cases.
- Performance artifact publisher signature verification is not implemented.
- Optional telemetry upload is not implemented.

## Change Rule
If Guardian behavior, authority boundaries, self-healing, redaction, launch/session safety, install repair, performance safety, or frontend safety rendering changes, update:
- `docs/GUARDIAN-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- any affected subsystem architecture doc or ADR
- any user-facing copy that describes Guardian mode behavior
